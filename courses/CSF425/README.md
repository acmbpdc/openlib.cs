# Deep Learning

## Overview

In the last decade due to the availability of cheap computational power and relevant software tools, several neural networks are explored to advance state-of-the-art of 
many hard AI problems. These architectures have successfully advanced various areas such as [`image searching`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), 
[`natural language understanding`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), [`medical applications`](https://www.jyi.org/2020-august/2020/8/24/applications-of-deep-learning-in-healthcare), 
[`autonomous vehicles`](https://becominghuman.ai/deep-learning-algorithms-in-self-driving-cars-14b13a895068) etc. All these problems rely on efficient, accurate and robust 
solutions for basic vision tasks such as [`image classification`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification), [`localization`](https://machinelearningmastery.com/object-recognition-with-deep-learning/) and
[`detection`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection). In this course students will be given an exposure to the details of [`neural networks`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) as well as deep learning architectures and to develop end-to-end 
models for such tasks. Students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks. This is a project oriented practical course in which every student 
has to develop a complete working model to solve some real-world problem.
