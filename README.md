# OpenLib.cs

testing

OpenLib.cs is a collaborative project to make textbooks, references, solution manuals and other resources freely available for students who are currently pursuing the following courses (or their equivalents) at university. As an open project, any member of the community can contribute his/her share to build an index of computer science references across the web.

## Usage

*   A directory is maintained for each course within which is a README that provides information regarding the course. The README may have the following sections if applicable :
    *   **Prerequisites** - Courses that need to be completed prior to attempting the particular course
    *   **Textbooks** - List of textbooks with links to their soft copies
    *   **Code** - Implementation of course concepts
    *   **Videos** - List of links of video explanations of course concepts
    *   **Websites** - Useful websites
    *   **Articles** - Cheat-sheets, tutorials, blog-posts etc.
    *   **Communities** - Online forums related to the course concepts
    *   **Apps** - Mobile apps that may enrich the learning experience
*   There are also [scripts](./scripts) that provide certain useful features (WIP)

## Guidelines

*   This repository provides links to the required study material such as **textbooks**, **solution manuals** and **reference books**.
*   Copies of the study material can be borrowed from the library while appearing for **open-book exams**. Moreover, printouts of the same can also be taken into the exam hall if required. Written notes are also allowed.
